Quantum GIS green space factor calculator plugin. The green space factor is a measure to quantify the amount of urban ecosystem services. The factor is the quota between the area of green/blue surface plus the amount of ecosystem service boost devided by the area of hard surface. This plugin helps you with the calculations and implements a model developed by the Swedish foundation C/O City.
